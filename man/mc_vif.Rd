\title{Variance Inflation Factor}
\usage{
mc_vif(df = NULL, predictors = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(required; data frame or tibble) A data frame with predictors. Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{predictors}{(optional; character vector) Character vector with the names of the predictive variables. Every element of this vector must be in the column names of \code{df}. Default: \code{NULL}}

\item{verbose}{(optional, logical) Set to \code{FALSE} to silence messages. Default: \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
Data frame with the columns "variable" containing the predictor name, and "vif" containing the variance inflation factor of the given variable.
}
\description{
Computes the Variance Inflation Factor of all variables in a training data frame.

The Variance Inflation Factor for a given variable \code{y} is computed as \code{1/(1-R2)}, where \code{R2} is the multiple R-squared of a multiple regression model fitted using \code{y} as response and all the remaining variables of the input data set as predictors. The equation can be interpreted as "the rate of perfect model's R-squared to the unexplained variance of this model".

The possible range of VIF values is (1, Inf]. A VIF lower than 10 suggest that removing \code{y} from the data set would reduce overall multicollinearity.

Please note that near-zero variance columns are ignored by this function. Use \code{\link[=mc_auto_vif]{mc_auto_vif()}} to remove them.
